                        Hi, I'm Kaitlin and I am 24 years old. I am originally from Cape May County, New Jersey. I am
                        currently studying in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
                        On the side, I work as an ESL (English as a second language) teacher online.
                        Previously, I have attended Camden County College, where I obtained my degree in Health Science
                        (Pre-Nursing Specialty).
                        I have experience in various different customer service positions that I have worked in
                        throughout school. I am a new web developer and I hope to continuously build on my knowledge and
                        skill set.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">I enjoy traveling and camping. Countries I have been to are Costa Rica
                        and the Dominican Republic.
                        I have camped within the east coast of the United States with family. Also, cats are my favorite
                        pet.
                        For exercise, I like to go for runs. It is good to run varying distances. My preferred distances
                        range from 1
                        to 5 miles.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        When I have off from work and school, I like to go out to eat with friends. I consider myself a
                        "foodie" and
                        I'm willing to try any kind of food. My favorite is Japanese fried rice, noodles, curry, and
                        sushi.
                        Also, when at home, I like to game to pass the time. When I was younger, I liked to
                        spend time on my GameBoy, GameCube, and online games. Now, I game on Ps4. My favorite game is
                        Fallout.
                        Some others I play are Destiny, Neverwinter, and Resident Evil.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        Also, I enjoy leisure reading. The genre I read the most is fantasy. I like series such as Harry
                        Potter,
                        The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Lunar Chronicles, and The Chronicles of Narnia. My favorite
                        series is Harry
                        Potter; I have read all the books twice and watched all the movies!!
